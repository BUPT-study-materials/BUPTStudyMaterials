/*
 * malloc.c --- a general purpose kernel memory allocator for Linux.
 * 
 * Written by Theodore Ts'o (tytso@mit.edu), 11/29/91
 *
 * This routine is written to be as fast as possible, so that it
 * can be called from the interrupt level.
 *
 * Limitations: maximum size of memory we can allocate using this routine
 *	is 4k, the size of a page in Linux.
 *
 * The general game plan is that each page (called a bucket) will only hold
 * objects of a given size.  When all of the object on a page are released,
 * the page can be returned to the general free pool.  When malloc() is
 * called, it looks for the smallest bucket size which will fulfill its
 * request, and allocate a piece of memory from that bucket pool.
 *
 * Each bucket has as its control block a bucket descriptor which keeps 
 * track of how many objects are in use on that page, and the free list
 * for that page.  Like the buckets themselves, bucket descriptors are
 * stored on pages requested from get_free_page().  However, unlike buckets,
 * pages devoted to bucket descriptor pages are never released back to the
 * system.  Fortunately, a system should probably only need 1 or 2 bucket
 * descriptor pages, since a page can hold 256 bucket descriptors (which
 * corresponds to 1 megabyte worth of bucket pages.)  If the kernel is using 
 * that much allocated memory, it's probably doing something wrong.  :-)
 *
 * Note: malloc() and free() both call get_free_page() and free_page()
 *	in sections of code where interrupts are turned off, to allow
 *	malloc() and free() to be safely called from an interrupt routine.
 *	(We will probably need this functionality when networking code,
 *	particularily things like NFS, is added to Linux.)  However, this
 *	presumes that get_free_page() and free_page() are interrupt-level
 *	safe, which they may not be once paging is added.  If this is the
 *	case, we will need to modify malloc() to keep a few unused pages
 *	"pre-allocated" so that it can safely draw upon those pages if
 * 	it is called from an interrupt routine.
 *
 * 	Another concern is that get_free_page() should not sleep; if it 
 *	does, the code is carefully ordered so as to avoid any race 
 *	conditions.  The catch is that if malloc() is called re-entrantly, 
 *	there is a chance that unecessary pages will be grabbed from the 
 *	system.  Except for the pages for the bucket descriptor page, the 
 *	extra pages will eventually get released back to the system, though,
 *	so it isn't all that bad.
