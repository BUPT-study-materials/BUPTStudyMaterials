 * Normally, Linux can get the drive parameters from the BIOS at
 * startup, but if this for some unfathomable reason fails, you'd
 * be left stranded. For this case, you can define HD_TYPE, which
 * contains all necessary info on your harddisk.
 *
 * The HD_TYPE macro should look like this:
 *
 * #define HD_TYPE { head, sect, cyl, wpcom, lzone, ctl}
 *
 * In case of two harddisks, the info should be sepatated by
 * commas:
 *
 * #define HD_TYPE { h,s,c,wpcom,lz,ctl },{ h,s,c,wpcom,lz,ctl }
 */
/*
 This is an example, two drives, first is type 2, second is type 3:

#define HD_TYPE { 4,17,615,300,615,8 }, { 6,17,615,300,615,0 }

 NOTE: ctl is 0 for all drives with heads<=8, and ctl=8 for drives
 with more than 8 heads.

 If you want the BIOS to tell what kind of drive you have, just
 leave HD_TYPE undefined. This is the normal thing to do.
